            I participated in the Let's Upgrade Student Ambassador program,
            where I had the opportunity to connect with a diverse tech
            community, enhance my networking skills, and stay updated with the
            latest industry trends. This experience not only broadened my
            understanding of various technological advancements but also
            helped me improve my leadership and communication abilities
            through active participation in events and discussions.

            I worked as a remote intern for one month as a web developer,
            where I developed several projects. These included a responsive
            landing page, a stopwatch web application, a Tic Tac Toe web
            application, and a weather app. Through this experience, I
            enhanced my skills in web development and gained hands-on
            experience in creating functional and user-friendly web
            applications. This internship allowed me to apply my theoretical
            knowledge to real-world projects and improve my problem-solving
            abilities.
